Antimony is a platform to design and manage <a href="https://containerlab.dev">containerlab</a> networks.

## Features

* **Designing Networks Easily**  
    Antimony offers a user friendly drag-and-drop interface to quickly and efficiently design containerlab networks. 
* **Side-By-Side Editor**

* **Deployment and Management of Instances**  
    Antimony's management interfaces grants full control over all scheduled, running and inactive containerlab instances.
* **Clabernetes Support**  
    Experimental support for the [clabernetes](https://containerlab.dev/manual/clabernetes/) backend that allows deployment on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) instances.
* **User Access Management via OpenID**  
    Antimony supports multi-user application through the OpenID provider of your choice.
* **Real-time Updates**  
    Antimony talks to containerlab and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and provides real-time information on containers such as deployment status, Docker stats and more!
* **Log Streaming**  
    The interface allows you to view containerlab and Docker logs in real-time. 

## Use cases

* **Educational Environment**  
    Antimony was developed with the main goal of being a platform for teachers to teach students about networking technology. The scalable architecture and external authentication make it easy to deploy Antimony in an educational environment.
* **Personal Use and Local Deployment**  
    The interface of Antimony aims to make designing and deploying containerlab networks easy and accesible for everyone. Deploying and using Antimony locally requires little to no experience with networks or the containerlab framework.
